# Nodes structure

- nodes/initial/: entry/first-ring logic (e.g., magic ring)
- nodes/transitions/: layer-to-layer scaffolding utilities
- nodes/final/: closing/terminating helpers (placeholder)
- nodes/index.js: barrels that re-export the above namespaces

This structure is intended to scale as more scenarios are added.
