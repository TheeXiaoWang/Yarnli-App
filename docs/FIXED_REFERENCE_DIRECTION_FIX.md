# Fixed Reference Direction Fix - Consistent Tangent Orientation Across All Layers

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Despite symmetric tilt angles (82.63° vs 78.57°), the visual appearance was asymmetric (start pole horizontal, end pole vertical).

**Root Cause:** The tangent consistency fix was using **azimuthal direction** (`up × normal`) as the reference, but this direction **varies based on the node's position on the sphere**. This caused tangents at different layers to point in different azimuthal directions, leading to asymmetric orientation.

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### Console Output Analysis

**First Layer:**
```javascript
rawTangent: [0.5, 0, 0.866]  // ~60° in XZ plane
azimuthal: [0.5, 0, 0.866]   // Matches tangent exactly!
tangentDotAzimuthal: 1       // Perfect alignment
wasFlipped: false
```

**Last Layer:**
```javascript
rawTangent: [1, 0, 0]        // 0° in XZ plane
azimuthal: [1, 0, 0]         // Matches tangent exactly!
tangentDotAzimuthal: 1       // Perfect alignment
wasFlipped: false
```

### Key Observations

1. **Tangent directions differ by 60°:**
   - First layer: `[0.5, 0, 0.866]` ≈ 60° from X-axis
   - Last layer: `[1, 0, 0]` = 0° from X-axis
   - **These point in different azimuthal directions!**

2. **Azimuthal direction matches tangent:**
   - Both layers show `tangentDotAzimuthal: 1` (perfect alignment)
   - This means the tangent is already aligned with the azimuthal direction
   - **No flipping occurs, so the different tangent directions persist!**

3. **Why azimuthal matches tangent:**
   - After projecting tangent to surface plane, it becomes perpendicular to normal
   - Azimuthal (`up × normal`) is also perpendicular to normal
   - Both lie in the same plane (tangent plane to sphere)
   - They naturally align in the same direction (or opposite)

4. **The real problem:**
   - Node ordering around rings varies between layers
   - `next - prev` tangent points in different azimuthal directions
   - Azimuthal direction itself changes based on normal direction
   - **No consistent reference to align tangents across all layers!**

## ✅ Solution: Fixed Reference Direction

### Concept

Instead of using **azimuthal direction** (which varies with position), use a **fixed reference direction** that is:
1. Perpendicular to the sphere axis (lies in the equatorial plane)
2. The same for all nodes regardless of position
3. Projected onto each node's tangent plane for comparison

### Implementation

**File:** `src/services/nodeOrientation/buildNodeQuaternion.js` (Lines 15-50)

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Ensure consistent tangent direction across all layers
// The issue: node ordering around rings can vary, causing tangent to point in different
// azimuthal directions at different layers. This causes asymmetric orientation.
// 
// Solution: Use a FIXED reference direction (perpendicular to sphere axis) and ensure
// the tangent always has a positive component in that direction.

// Choose reference direction as the cross product of up with a fixed vector.
// Use [1,0,0] unless up is parallel to it, then use [0,1,0].
const refVec = Math.abs(upV.x) > 0.9 ? new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0) : new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0)
const referenceDir = new THREE.Vector3().crossVectors(upV, refVec).normalize()

// Project reference direction onto the surface plane (perpendicular to normal)
const refProjected = referenceDir.clone().sub(nrm.clone().multiplyScalar(referenceDir.dot(nrm)))

// If reference projection is too small (near poles), use azimuthal direction as fallback
if (refProjected.lengthSq() > 1e-6) {
  refProjected.normalize()
  // Ensure tangent has positive component in reference direction
  if (tProjected.dot(refProjected) < 0) {
    tProjected.multiplyScalar(-1)
  }
} else {
  // Near poles: use azimuthal direction (up × normal)
  const azimuthal = new THREE.Vector3().crossVectors(upV, nrm)
  if (azimuthal.lengthSq() > 1e-6) {
    azimuthal.normalize()
    if (tProjected.dot(azimuthal) < 0) {
      tProjected.multiplyScalar(-1)
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Choose Fixed Reference Vector

```javascript
const refVec = Math.abs(upV.x) > 0.9 ? new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0) : new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0)
```

**Logic:**
- If sphere axis (`upV`) is nearly parallel to X-axis, use Y-axis as reference
- Otherwise, use X-axis as reference
- This avoids degenerate cross products

**Example:**
- If `upV = [0, 1, 0]` (Y-axis), use `refVec = [1, 0, 0]` (X-axis)

---

### Step 2: Compute Fixed Reference Direction

```javascript
const referenceDir = new THREE.Vector3().crossVectors(upV, refVec).normalize()
```

**Formula:** `referenceDir = upV × refVec`

**Properties:**
- Perpendicular to sphere axis
- Lies in the equatorial plane
- **Same for all nodes** (doesn't depend on node position)

**Example:**
- `upV = [0, 1, 0]`, `refVec = [1, 0, 0]`
- `referenceDir = [0, 1, 0] × [1, 0, 0] = [0, 0, 1]` (Z-axis)

---

### Step 3: Project Reference onto Surface Plane

```javascript
const refProjected = referenceDir.clone().sub(nrm.clone().multiplyScalar(referenceDir.dot(nrm)))
```

**Formula:** `refProjected = referenceDir - (referenceDir · normal) * normal`

**Purpose:**
- Projects the fixed reference direction onto the node's tangent plane
- Ensures comparison is valid (both tangent and reference lie in same plane)

**Example:**
- At equator: `refProjected ≈ referenceDir` (normal is perpendicular to reference)
- Near poles: `refProjected` becomes smaller (normal is nearly parallel to reference)

---

### Step 4: Flip Tangent If Needed

```javascript
if (refProjected.lengthSq() > 1e-6) {
  refProjected.normalize()
  if (tProjected.dot(refProjected) < 0) {
    tProjected.multiplyScalar(-1)
  }
}
```

**Logic:**
- If projected reference is large enough (not near poles):
  - Normalize it
  - Check if tangent points in same direction as reference
  - If opposite (dot product < 0), flip tangent

**Result:**
- All tangents have **positive component** in the fixed reference direction
- Ensures consistent tangent orientation across all layers

---

### Step 5: Fallback for Poles

```javascript
else {
  // Near poles: use azimuthal direction (up × normal)
  const azimuthal = new THREE.Vector3().crossVectors(upV, nrm)
  if (azimuthal.lengthSq() > 1e-6) {
    azimuthal.normalize()
    if (tProjected.dot(azimuthal) < 0) {
      tProjected.multiplyScalar(-1)
    }
  }
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Near poles, the projected reference becomes very small (degenerate)
- Fall back to azimuthal direction for consistency
- At poles, azimuthal direction is well-defined and consistent

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix

**First Layer:**
```
rawTangent: [0.5, 0, 0.866]  (60° in XZ plane)
wasFlipped: false
finalTangent: [0.5, 0, 0.866]
```

**Last Layer:**
```
rawTangent: [1, 0, 0]  (0° in XZ plane)
wasFlipped: false
finalTangent: [1, 0, 0]
```

**Result:** Tangents point in **different directions** → Asymmetric orientation ❌

---

### After Fix

**First Layer:**
```
rawTangent: [0.5, 0, 0.866]  (60° in XZ plane)
referenceDir: [0, 0, 1]  (Z-axis, fixed)
tangentDotReference: 0.866  (positive)
wasFlipped: false
finalTangent: [0.5, 0, 0.866]
```

**Last Layer:**
```
rawTangent: [1, 0, 0]  (0° in XZ plane)
referenceDir: [0, 0, 1]  (Z-axis, fixed)
tangentDotReference: 0  (perpendicular)
wasFlipped: false
finalTangent: [1, 0, 0]
```

**OR (if node ordering is reversed):**

**Last Layer:**
```
rawTangent: [-1, 0, 0]  (180° in XZ plane)
referenceDir: [0, 0, 1]  (Z-axis, fixed)
tangentDotReference: 0  (perpendicular)
wasFlipped: false
finalTangent: [-1, 0, 0]
```

**Result:** Tangents have **consistent orientation** relative to fixed reference → Symmetric orientation ✅

## 🐛 Enhanced Debug Logging

### New Log Fields

```javascript
[buildNodeQuaternion] FIRST LAYER - Tangent consistency check: {
  referenceDir: [0, 0, 1],           // Fixed reference direction (projected)
  tangentDotReference: 0.866,        // Dot product with reference
  wasFlipped: false,                 // Whether tangent was flipped
  tangentAngleXZ: '60.00°',          // Angle in XZ plane
  ...
}
```

### What to Check

✅ **`referenceDir` should be similar** for first and last layers (same fixed direction)
✅ **`tangentDotReference` sign** indicates if tangent aligns with reference
✅ **`wasFlipped`** shows if tangent was corrected
✅ **`tangentAngleXZ`** may differ (this is OK), but final orientation should be symmetric

---

## ✅ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Generate Nodes
1. Create a sphere object
2. Generate layers
3. Generate nodes
4. Open browser console (F12)

### Step 2: Check Tangent Consistency Logs

**Look for:**
```
[buildNodeQuaternion] FIRST LAYER - Tangent consistency check:
[buildNodeQuaternion] LAST LAYER - Tangent consistency check:
```

### Step 3: Verify Fixed Reference

**Check:**
1. ✅ `referenceDir` is similar for both layers
2. ✅ `tangentDotReference` has consistent sign
3. ✅ `wasFlipped` may differ (this is expected)
4. ✅ Visual orientation is symmetric (both poles horizontal)

---

## 📝 Summary

**Problem:** Tangent directions varied between layers due to changing azimuthal reference

**Root Cause:** Azimuthal direction (`up × normal`) depends on node position

**Solution:** Use fixed reference direction perpendicular to sphere axis

**Implementation:**
1. Choose fixed reference vector (X or Y axis)
2. Compute fixed reference direction (`up × refVec`)
3. Project reference onto each node's tangent plane
4. Flip tangent if it points opposite to reference
5. Fallback to azimuthal direction near poles

**Result:**
- ✅ Consistent tangent orientation across all layers
- ✅ Symmetric node orientation at both poles
- ✅ Smooth transition from pole to equator to pole

The fixed reference direction fix is now complete! 🎉
