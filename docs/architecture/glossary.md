## Glossary

- Layer: A ring/contour in 3D with `y` (axis projection) and `polylines`.
- Polyline: Ordered points approximating a ring on a layer.
- Marker poles: Two reference points defining an axis; derive plane/origin.
- Magic Ring (MR): Initial crochet loop to seed nodes.
- Node: Planned stitch anchor point `[x,y,z]` on a ring.
- Scaffold: Line segments connecting nodes across layers for visualization.
- Stitch gauge: Effective stitch width/height based on yarn and stitch type.
- Increase/Decrease plan: How stitch counts change across layers.
- Handedness: Right/left orientation affecting angular ordering.
- Start ring (ring0): First detected/selected layer ring used to project MR.
